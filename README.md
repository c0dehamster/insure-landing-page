## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   BEM naming convention

### What I learned

I used this project as an opportunity to learn more about accessibility best practices. This turned out to be a rather
complex topic in case of some parts of the page such as the drop-down navigation, the list of links to social media, the
extended navigation in the footer. There are likely still things to be improved.

The project required to use multiple pseudo-elements for various decorative elements. These were fun to move around to
achieve the desired configuration of background images and borders.

### Continued development

I am planning to do more "realistic" projects like this to practice my layout skills.
